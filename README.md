This project is an AI-powered system designed for automated detection, classification, and cost estimation of vehicle damages using image processing and deep learning techniques. It streamlines insurance claim processing and reduces manual intervention by providing quick and accurate assessments based on vehicle images.

#Features *Vehicle damage detection using deep learning (VGG16 / CNN) *Damage classification (minor, moderate, major) *Cost estimation based on damage severity *Web interface for image upload and result display *Ideal for use in car insurance, rental, and repair industries

#Technologies used *Python *TensorFlow / Keras (VGG16 model) *OpenCV for image processing *Flask / Streamlit for front-end *SQLite / JSON for storing results
